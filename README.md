# Overview

We built individual-based simulations in C++ to study the evolution of learning. 
The source files and the example of the parameter file are provided in this repository.

The executable file (evolution_of_learning.exe) can be used to run the model on a Windows computer.

The parameter json file should be provided as a command line argument to run the simulation.
The parameter file's name has to end with _Parameters.json
